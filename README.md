# Pupil diameter tracked during motor adaptation in humans: MATLAB codes and related data

This repository contains MATLAB codes and related data to reproduce the Figures (except for schematics) and related analyses in Yokoi and Weiler (2022) paper "Pupil diameter tracked during motor adaptation in humans" (doi: https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00021.2022). Each sub-folders contains codes (`/code`), data (`/data`), and some resultant figures (`/figure`), respectively. To make the codes work, all the contents (i.e., `/code`, `/data`, and `/figure`) of this repository need to be downloaded.

## Dependency
The following softwares/toolboxes need to be correctly installed to run the present codes.
- MATLAB R2015b (consistency is not guaranteed for other versions)
- Dataframe toolbox (https://github.com/jdiedrichsen/dataframe)

Note also that I haven't tested if the code correctly works on PCs.

## Main functions to reproduce figures
Here is a short summary of two main codes for reproducing behabioral and imaging figures. For more detail, see help messages for each function. 
 
|Function |Description |Example |
|----|--------|----|
|xxxx.m |Reproduces figures for behavioral analyses. | `xxxx('Figure_all')` |
